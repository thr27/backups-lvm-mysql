Overview
--------
A simple wrapper script to do a MySQL flush, lock, LVM snapshot, unlock, then backup.
See http://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/mysql-backups-using-lvm-snapshots for a good explanation.

Installation
------------
The trivial script `install.sh` copies ~everything from the source directory to /etc/backups-lvm-mysql/
and installs a crontab. You'll want to change the configuration options. Main conf is `backups-conf`.
May also want to change cron times - or just not use the cron at all. If deps are met everything will work.

Usage
-----

    /etc/backups-lvm-mysql/backups.sh

Dependencies
------------
 
 * cron
 * lvm
 * php5

Notes
-----
This setup simply keeps one local snapshot. Remote backup that syncs and rotates that snapshot is a good idea.
